## Analysis of Employment at Citigroup Inc.
#### Hanaan Shafi & Sudarshan Khadka

Citigroup Inc. is an investment bank and financial services corportation headquarted in Lower Manhattan, New York. It was founded in 1998, and has grown to become the third largest bank in the United States. <br>

In this project, we study employment at Citigroup. Our dataset contains labor data based on region, role, gender, time period, number of employees, and inflow/outflow. We begin our report studying general trends on employment before examining these closer in the context of binary genders. We end with an in-depth of analysis of these trends in the Arab World.

Unfortunately the nature of our data set was such that employment was reported in terms of the traditional, binary genders. We hope to conduct more inclusive analyses in the future.
